# CFP App frontend from the RustFest team

This is a Call for Proposals submission form built by the [team behind the RustFest Global conference](https://rustfest.world/news/say-hello-rustfest-global-2021#compile-once-run-anywhere). The form can be used to implement a more inclusive, less stressful process for community conferences who would like to make their event accessible to a wider range of submitters from around the world.

The app is fully customizable and open source, and comes with a matching backend and administration/CFP selection interface (work-in-progress).

You may use [`create-cfp-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-cfp-app) to quickly spin up a new instance for testing or deployment.
